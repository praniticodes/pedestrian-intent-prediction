# Pedestrian Intent Prediction Using Pose Estimation and Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a pedestrian intends to cross a road using pose landmarks and machine learning.

## 🔍 Overview
We use MediaPipe for extracting pose keypoints and a Random Forest classifier to predict crossing intent from static pedestrian images.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3
- Google Colab
- MediaPipe, OpenCV
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Files
- `pedestrian_intent_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `dataset.zip` – Labeled images (optional)
- `test_image.jpg` – Sample image
- `README.md` – Project details

## 🚀 How it Works
1. Upload pedestrian image
2. Extract pose landmarks
3. Predict crossing intent using ML model

## 📌 Project Status
Prototype (Works on images, extendable to video)
